    <h2>About Me </h2>
    <p> I am currently a <strong>biology </strong> major at the University of Notre Dame. I have no idea what my plans are for after graduation. I am trying to weigh all options from graduate school to entering the workforce. I decided that I do <em>not </em> want to attend medical school nor a career in research. I hope to have all this figured out soon.  </p>

    
    <h2> Good Quotes </h2>
    <blockquote> <p>There is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and there always has been. The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that "my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge." 
      -Issac Asimov </p>
      <p> It has become almost a cliche to remark that nobody boasts of ignorance of literature, but it is socially acceptable to boast ignorance of science and proudly claim incompetence in mathematics. -Richard Dawkins </p>
